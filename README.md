# Greyhound Race Prediction using GRU

This repository contains the code and resources for a project that uses a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model to predict greyhound races.

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the outcomes of greyhound races based on previous form data. The model used is a GRU, a type of recurrent neural network that is particularly suited to time-series data.
